Here is a review about what I got from participating in the competition:
Leadership
Being the captain of the Team NCKU, my role was a &amp;ldquo;buffer&amp;rdquo; between the competition organizer and our teammates.
Confidence in speaking English
My past experiences of speaking English were bad. The most occasions where I had to speak English were interviews.</description></item><item><title>PyTorch RNN Tutorial</title><link>https://eri24816.github.io/blog_2/zh/post/rnn_tutorial/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 12:54:18 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://eri24816.github.io/blog_2/zh/post/rnn_tutorial/</guid><description>This tutorial will demonstrate how to build and train a simple RNN model with PyTorch.
Concepts What can an RNN do? Given an input sequence $x=[x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_{n}]$, an RNN can generate a corresponding output sequence $\hat y=[\hat y_1,\hat y_2,\cdots,\hat y_{n}]$ successively. The strength of RNN is that it can &amp;ldquo;remember&amp;rdquo; its previosly seen input elements. When calculating $\hat y_i$, the model can access not only $x_i$ but also the information from $x_0$ to $x_{i-1}$, via its hidden state, $h_{i-1}$.</description></item></channel></rss>
