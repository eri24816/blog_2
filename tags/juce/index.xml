They are a subset of all possible sound waves, with some specific mathematical characteristics which make them sound bright but gentle at the same time. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to understand what&amp;rsquo;s the magic inside the sounds of piano from i was 12 maybe till now, but I guess my math is still too bad to actually understand it from a fundamental aspect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently I try to make a synthesizer for piano by directly simulate the vibration of piano string and sample audio from it. Although the result sounds not actually like a real piano, the journey of implementing the synth is interesting enough to write down here.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
